# TelemedicineRiskCalculator

Electronic tool for the calculation of the GSS and consideration of telemedicine as a new standard of care. 

This tool consists of a web application accessible in http://telemedicineriskcalculator.000webhostapp.com. 
The website uses HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies following the W3C specification so that it is widely supported across all devices and browsers. 
Moreover, we considered the mobile first strategy, but it has also been tested to work appropriately in desktop computers so that any user can take advantage of our tool.
